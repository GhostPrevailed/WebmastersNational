            <p> Green energy, also reffered to as Renewable energy, is energy sourced from  resources that are available naturally and quickly in nature. This is contrast to fossil fuels which aren't infinite like green energy and they also cause a lot of harm to the environment, unlike green energy.
                Examples of green energy can include solar power, wind power, hydroelectricity and more. 
                These sources are always going to be available in nature and they cause significantly less harm to nature than fossil fuels. Green energy is the most important factor in fighting back climate change, which is <br> heavily caused by fossil fuel extraction.

            <div class="title" id="Importance"> Why is this important?</div> <br>
            <p>Green Energy is considered to be important because, while providing the energy that we need in our lives, it also doesnâ€™t damage the environment like fossil fuels. Also, it reduces our carbon footprint and mitigates the severe effects that climate change had on Earth. It also produces significantly less greenhouse gas emissions when comparing to fossil fuels. Green energy provides new economic opportunities because devices need to be made to obtain that energy and improves public health due to better air quality.

            <p> The amount of energy we use has a huge impact on climate change. The temperature went up by 1.5 degrees celsius during the past year, and the temperature is projected to increase by 2.5 more degrees celsius by 2030, which is 20 years less than expected, that being 2050. This needs to be slowed down, so we need to start using renewable energy, which helps develop our houses into eco-friendly areas. The rate of climate change would decrease due to this practice. This website was made to help compile information for homeowners on green and clean energy home solutions and other initiatives. This website provides the basic information, cost, tax rebates, and green/clean energy practices that homeowners can use. </p><br>
            <h2> Our Mission: </h2>
            <p> Our goal, by this website, is to hopefully convice you to start your clean energy journey. Even a single implementation of LED lights in your house will mean a success to us. Little Drops make an ocean.</p>
